                RowdyBooks is designed for UTSA students to provide a way
                for them to buy and trade books in both physical and
                E-book formats. RowdyBooks allows students to trade their
                textbooks with other students when they no longer need them.
                This gives students a chance to get a textbook they will
                need by trading the ones they are not using anymore or
                provide them access to affordable textbooks.
